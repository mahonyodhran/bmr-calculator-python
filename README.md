` Note: If running locally, due to ENV_VARS being set for SMTP server using please do not select to receive email or it will crash - alternatively, create a .env file and make SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, DEVEMAIL variables. I used Mailtrap for this, the email actually goes to that sandbox rather than your inbox - for now.`
